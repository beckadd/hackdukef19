## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r shiny-io, echo=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  numericInput("salary", label = "", value = 0),
  numericInput("want-to-spend", label = "", value = 0),
  selectInput("what-region", 
              label = "What Region are you From?",
              choices = c("Northeast","Midwest","South","West"))

)
server <- function(input, output) {
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
