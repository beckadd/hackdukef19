Buzzle is an energy savings calculator that allows individuals who want to become more environmentally-conscious and sustainable by quantifying their energy use. Buzzle provides scores and predictive analyses through data visualizations allowing individuals to observe their change in energy spendings. Depending on their current daily energy consumption choices and willingness to invest in upfront costs for sustainable alternatives, Buzzle suggests individuals with possible options they can take, long-term benefits it would bring to their net income, and connects them to relevant businesses/resources.

The energy savings calculatoror provides two quantifications:
1) Environmental score that gamifies sustainability. 
The score ranges from 0-100. The higher the score, the better their current energy use performance. 

2) Financial predictions
The calculator produces data visualization of changes to their net income depending on sustainable actions they decide to pursue.

We used R, Matlab, Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Figma to create the varying components of our project. Our major problems were cleaning the raw dataset and integrating the components together to form one cohesive projects as our members came from different language backgrounds.
